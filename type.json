Mouth-watering and clean, this wine has a complexity that is nearly impossible to dislike.\n\nIncredibly fruit forward for an “old world” wine, Albariño sings the song of relaxed and fulfilling Spanish coastal life.\n\nThe wines are bottled early to preserve ripe freshness of fruit with a bracing acidity that will cascade across the palate and accentuate notes of apples, lime, peaches, flowers and grass. A cleansing minerality on the finish leases the palate ready for more. If aged in oak, which not all are, you will taste subtleties of vanilla and dill.\n\nThe wine does not age well and should be consumed within a couple of years of bottling. It is also budget friendly so stock up.\n\nAlbariño is a classic example of how the local dishes of the region, like traditional Spanish Coastal foods, pair extraordinarily well with the wine. Try this wine with prawns, scallops, shellfish, lobster, and mussels. It also makes a delicious digestif.","blurb":null,"interesting_facts":["Albariño is considered the New World wine of the Old World.","Albariño Day is celebrated on 9 May!","Albariño consists of more than 90% of wine grown and produced in the Rias Baixas region of Spain."],"body":3,"body_description":"Medium-bodied","acidity":3,"acidity_description":"High","country":{"code":"es","name":"Spain","native_name":"España","seo_name":"spain","currency":{"code":"EUR","name":"Euros","prefix":"€","suffix":null},"regions_count":149,"users_count":1395417,"wines_count":98121,"wineries_count":15494,"most_used_grapes":[{"id":19,"name":"Tempranillo","seo_name":"tempranillo","has_detailed_info":true,"wines_count":113205},{"id":2,"name":"Cabernet Sauvignon","seo_name":"cabernet-sauvignon","has_detailed_info":true,"wines_count":519272},{"id":142,"name":"Garnacha","seo_name":"garnacha","has_detailed_info":true,"wines_count":36476}]},"wine_type_id":2,"food":[{"id":5,"name":"Pasta","background_image":{"location":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/7QtlGNGMTTO-zmSM0DLUiA.jpg","variations":{"small":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/thumbs/7QtlGNGMTTO-zmSM0DLUiA_932x810.jpg"}},"seo_name":null},{"id":13,"name":"Shellfish","background_image":{"location":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/ADrHxo56T5mjCwTmFktYbQ.jpg","variations":{"small":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/thumbs/ADrHxo56T5mjCwTmFktYbQ_932x810.jpg"}},"seo_name":"shellfish"},{"id":19,"name":"Vegetarian","background_image":{"location":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/WxPUf8WLTsWRR1yFXAKPzg.jpg","variations":{"small":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/thumbs/WxPUf8WLTsWRR1yFXAKPzg_932x810.jpg"}},"seo_name":"vegetarian"},{"id":27,"name":"Appetizers and snacks","background_image":{"location":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/OKUgIsF5Rrev1y_7ptvJFA.jpg","variations":{"small":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/thumbs/OKUgIsF5Rrev1y_7ptvJFA_932x810.jpg"}},"seo_name":null},{"id":28,"name":"Lean fish","background_image":{"location":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/c3WsbKq6SZ-Duv7ypRtDIA.jpg","variations":{"small":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/thumbs/c3WsbKq6SZ-Duv7ypRtDIA_932x810.jpg"}},"seo_name":null}],"grapes":[{"id":49,"name":"Albariño","seo_name":"albarino","has_detailed_info":false,"wines_count":9377}],"region":null},{"id":2,"seo_name":"portuguese-alentejo-red","regional_name":"Portuguese","varietal_name":"Alentejo Red","name":"Portuguese Alentejo Red","image":null,"background_image":null,"description":"The Alentejo region covers approximately a third of Portugal, producing red wines that are easy-drinking and fruit-forward.\n\nAragonez is the most widely-planted red grape in the region, which produces full-bodied, budget friendly red wines.

It is produced primarily from the Corvina grape. Amarone is characterized by ripe, bold flavors.\n\nDirectly after harvest, the grapes are air dried through a process called “appassimento”, which allows them to shrivel into raisins. This concentrates the sugar and flavors in the grapes, producing a distinctive and full-bodied wine well-suited to aging.\n\nIt is often said that you can safely forget an Amarone in your wine cellar. Even average Amarones can be aged for 10-15 years. Depending on the vintage and aging technique, wines of exceptional quality can be enjoyed up to 30-50 years after bottling!\n\nIn wine, time equals money. The aging process, manual labor, and prime grape-growing real estate mean that Amarone is often quite expensive. Bottles of this iconic wine generally start at $50-$60, but the sky's the limit when it comes to price.\n\nDespite its iconic status, Amarone only received DOCG recognition as recently as 2009.\n\nAmarone is best paired with very rich foods, due to its strong flavor profile, robust nature, and high alcohol (minimum 14% abv).","blurb":"Corvina-based DOCG wine from Veneto","interesting_facts":["Due to the drying process, Amarone requires at least double the amount of grapes to produce a single bottle of wine.","Amarone was invented by accident in the early 20th century when a barrel of sweet Recioto wine was accidentally left to ferment too long.","“Amarone” translates to “the great bitter” in Italian, which references the wine's mistaken origin from a sweet wine.","After production, many winemakers use the grape skins to add depth of flavor to standard Valpolicella wines, creating Valpolicella Ripasso.","The drying process was traditionally done on straw mats.

The best Bordeaux blends tend to come from cooler climate regions such as Coonawarra and Margaret River, but they can also be found in Yarra Valley, South Australia, McLaren Vale, and Orange.\n\nAs with other Bordeaux blends, these full-bodied wines are best paired with red meat and hearty fare that can stand up to their strong tannins and full body.","blurb":"Cabernet and Merlot

has a cool marine coastal climate, with mild weather and no dry season. Bordeaux reds tend to be lower in alcohol and are slightly lighter in body.\n\nStylistically, they exhibit more nuanced flavors and less up-front fruit. Sophisticated and elegant, they pair well with game meats, roast lamb, or hearty beef stews.\n\nBordeaux is the largest wine producing region in France. It consists of two major areas—the Left and the Right Bank. Both lie in the heart of the Gironde estuary and are further divided by its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers.\n\nWhile the Right Bank produces blends that are mostly Merlot dominant, the Left Bank produces blends that are primarily Cabernet Sauvignon dominant.\n\nBordeaux reds are said to be terroir-driven (if you like French wines, you'll hear this term a lot). Terroir is a concise way to define a specific region based upon the soil, climate, and the collective knowledge of the generations of people who have farmed the land.\n\nWhen shopping for Bordeaux reds, keep in mind, French wines are all about the region and the blend, not about individual grape varieties.

But don't worry, that's still over 7 million cases of white wine!\n\nAs with the reds, Bordeaux Blanc are mostly blends. The most common variety is Sémillon, followed by Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle. Bordeaux is also home to some of the most famous dessert wines in the world, from the renowned Sauternes sub-appellation and Barsac.\n\nThe best dry white wines are from the Graves region, and are usually lightly oak aged. White Bordeaux often possess vibrant acidity and elegant citrus notes that lean toward white grapefruit. These brilliant, charming whites are exquisite when paired with scallops, roast chicken with tarragon, asparagus quiche or salads with shaved fennel.\n\nSauternes owe their characteristic depth and concentration to Botrytis cinerea (or Noble Rot, an infection which causes the grapes to shrivel). The quintessential French pairing with Sauternes is foie gras, or duck paté. Soft-ripened cheeses and desserts like crème brûlée are excellent matches.

Early vintages of Champagne were dubbed “the devil's wine” because the bottles tended to explode. Improvements to both bottle and cork developed over hundreds of years.\n\nChampagne is made from a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Munier grapes, and most of it is produced as a non-vintage wine, meaning that it's a blend of several vintages. Generally speaking, non-vintage Champagne is fantastic, and tends to be less expensive than vintage Champagne—this is because a vintage year is only declared when growing conditions are especially favorable.\n\nThe convivial nature of Champagne is due in part to how it's made. Following primary fermentation and bottling, a secondary alcoholic fermentation is induced in the bottle, which is achieved by the addition of yeast and rock sugar. The bubbles we love so much are a natural byproduct of this magical secondary fermentation, in the form of carbon dioxide.","blurb":"Premium sparkling wine","interesting_facts":["Champagne has a natural affinity for comfort foods like mac \u0026 cheese, fried chicken and buttered popcorn.","Fearing assassination, Tsar Alexander II of Russia ordered that his favorite Champagne be made in clear, flat-bottomed bottles, so that a bomb could not be hidden inside.

over 100,000 acres in production, Chardonnay claims more acreage than any other wine grape in California, and reigns supreme as the most popular wine consumed in the US (that's including reds and whites).\n\nChardonnay can trace its humble origins to Burgundy. Today it is the most widely planted white wine grape in the world. Why?\n\nChardonnay is prized because it's a hardy, vigorous vine that readily reflects “terroir” (a French term referring to the characteristics imparted to a wine by the climate and soil in which it is grown). Stylistically, Chardonnay can be clean with bright acidity or full-bodied with tropical notes and varying degrees of oak. In California, the latter is the more popular style.\n\nSonoma Coast Chards have more acidity. The coastal fog lends a degree of cooling and these wines will often exhibit pear and crisp apple notes, as well as lively citrus characteristics. Napa Valley Chards lean toward a riper and fuller style, with tropical fruit notes. Oak aging adds layers of vanilla, spice, butter and toasted hazelnut.\n\nOakier Chards with a slightly buttery profile have a natural affinity with rich seafood such as lobster or halibut. They also stand up well to eggs benedict, pork chops stuffed with apples or roasted butternut squash. Crisper, unoaked Chards are best paired with prawns, crab cakes, salads with mangos and or even mild curries.","blurb":null,"interesting_facts":["Chardonnay is one of the principal grapes used in the production of sparkling wine, and of course, Champagne.","Wente Vineyards established the first commercial plantings of Chardonnay in Livermore during the 1940s.","At the Judgement of Paris, a legendary wine competition held in Paris in 1973, Château Montelena beat top notch Chardonnays from Burgundy.","Malolactic fermentation is responsible for that famous buttery note in Chardonnay.

what Italy means to the world of wine.\n\nFermented primarily from Sangiovese, fresh cherry,  strawberries, and red plum pleasure the senses when enjoying this wine.\n\nWinemakers have spent the last couple of decades trying to change the old image of Chianti: Wine bottles in wicker basket, interestingly also called fiascoes. They've done so by  by producing very nice wines through state of the art growing and fermentation techniques.\n\nChianti is a red wine that comes from Tuscany, but can contain small amounts of white grapes during blending. This is not the case with Chianti Classico, which must be solely made from red Sangiovese grapes.\n\nChianti is not considered to age well, and loses steam quickly.  Find the youngest bottle you can to get the most out of its vibrance.\n\nThis wine is versatile and its high acidity allows it to be eaten with a wide range of foods.  Enjoy Chianti best with fast food, pizza, red pasta, and salami sandwiches.","blurb":"Sangiovese-based DOCG wine from Tuscany","interesting_facts":["Chianti dates back to the 13th century.

They include Touriga Nacional, Alfrocheiro, Tinta Roriz, Jaen, Baga, Bastardo and Tinta Pinheira.

They pair well with a wide range of food making them an easy choice for a dinner.\n\nBeing surrounded by mountains on all sides has its advantages. The Dão region is protected from the climate of the continent and from the ocean. The elevation also gives the wine much of its character. Elevation ranges between 600 feet to 3,000 feet at some points.\n\nMost vineyards have small plots dotted through various hillsides and elevations. The soil is very poor making for stronger vines that can survive the shifts from cool nights to hot days.\n\nThe region is still considered off the beaten path and great value can be found in many of the wines. The lusher wines have the ability to age for up to 20 years or possibly more.","blurb":"Red wine from Northern Portugal","interesting_facts":["Dão nobre (means noble Dão), this is saved for reserve wines.","Garrafeira requires wines to be 0.5% higher in alcohol and requires two or more years spent in oak.","Tinta Roriz is an indigenous grape to the region.

Because Alsace is proximal to Germany, cradled in the shadow of the Vosges Mountain range and just east of the Rhine River, it shares many common grape varieties.\n\nGewürztraminer can trace its lineage to Alsace, and is the second most planted variety in the region.\n\nGewürztraminer is an aromatic grape, this is typically expressed as exotic fruits such as lychee, star fruit, passion fruit or mango. In addition to lush fruit notes, a host of other aromatics makes for a complex and heady elixir—orange peel, roses, honey, and baking spices are also common fragrances. A deep gold color, it tends to be full-bodied with fairly low acidity and sometimes has a lovely spritz (or slight effervescence).\n\nAs a rule, Alsatian Gewürztraminer is unoaked, and is produced in both a dry and off-dry style. Late Harvest Gewürz are made as well, generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (or SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).\n\nUniversally known as the wine to pair with spicy Asian cuisine, Gewürztraminer has a broader range of pairing potential. Both dry and off-dry Gewürztraminer will compliment roast duck, washed-rind cheeses like Epoisses, cream of potato soup, bratwurst, omelets with smoked salmon and pizza with figs and Praga ham. Pair off-dry Gewürztraminer with foie gras, apple tartin, or desserts featuring tropical fruit.","blurb":null,"interesting_facts":["Literally translated, Gewürztraminer means “spicy Traminer” and is thought to be a mutation of Sauvignon Blanc.","Alsatian wines are bottled in tall, flute shaped bottles called vin du Rhin or “Rhine wine bottle”.

Now, despite ripping up almost half of the Grenache vineyards, Spain is still producing amazing wines with Grenache. These wines range from affordable everyday wines to lavishly expensive world-class affairs.\n\nThese garnet-colored, fruit-forward wines showcase delightful flavors of candied red fruit, cinnamon, and black pepper.

popular, Argentinian Malbec is an inky, medium-bodied, dry red wine with strong impressions of dark fruits on the nose and palate. This wine tends to have mellower tannins than its French counterpart.\n\nHeavily dependent on where they are grown for variations in flavor, Argentinian Malbec has quickly become a world favorite due to the characteristics that the high altitude climate and soils impart to the fruit.\n\nOriginally from France, it is one of the original 5 “Bordeaux” grapes. It is scarcely planted in France anymore.\n\nIt has found an amazingly hospitable home in the mountains of Argentina from which some of the world's best selling Malbecs are grown.\n\nStarkly different from French versions in structure and flavor, this wine is a good investment for collectors, as the wine can age for several years before drinking.This wine also pairs very well with any savory red meat dish-- particularly dishes that include spice.","blurb":null,"interesting_facts":["World Malbec day is celebrated on April 17.","Growers invest fortunes in specialized netting to protect Malbec

It was brought to South America in 1850 and has since found its home at high altitudes in Argentina and Chile.\n\nMalbec is a thin-skinned varietal that requires a lot of sun to ripen. Regions such as Maipo, Colchagua, and Maule are producing excellent Malbecs despite the growing conditions being very different in each region.\n\nMalbec loves big bold flavors and extremely juicy meats.

These wines are famous all over the world for their delicate sweetness and carbonation, which makes them immensely approachable and endlessly enjoyable.\n\nTrue Moscato d'Asti should not be confused with the slightly inferior Asti Spumante. Moscato d'Asti will always be about 5.5% alcohol and lightly fizzy and can be the perfect light wine for dessert or even breakfast. It often contains delightfully pungent aromas of white peaches, fresh white blossoms, and bright citrus.","blurb":"Sparkling DOCG wine from Piedmont","interesting_facts":["Due to its low alcohol and

wines of Northern Italy include some of the most well known red wines in the country including Nebbiolo, Barbera, Dolcetto, Amarone and Valpolicella.\n\nArguably, the two most important regions in Northern Italy are Piedmont in the northwest, and Veneto in the northeast. Red wines from these regions range from some of the most expensive and sought after in all of Italy to great value red wines.\n\nNebbiolo produces some of the most exclusive and expensive red wines in Italy, including Barolo and Barbaresco. However, these sought after wines come with a hefty price tag.\n\nDolcetto and Barbera from Piedmont offer relative value.

Chardonnay seems to grow anywhere grapes can grow; although Italian varieties are not normally coveted quality.\n\nGewürztraminer usually makes us think of Germany, but it's also thriving in Northern Italy. The warmer climate imparts a little less sugar and little more acidity than its German cousin.\n\nThen there is Moscato.

counterparts. Grown and produced in Northeast France, the volcanic and limestone soils provide the perfect canvas for a wine of superlatives and class.\n\nOne should do what they must to ensure that life is not spent without having experienced the complexity and sumptuousness of Alsatian Pinot Gris.\n\nHistorically Alsace has been in a tug-of war between France and Germany, but France won. What this means for the wine is that production methods and nuances of both countries make their way into the bottles this region produces.\n\nThe wines are full-bodied, with a flavorful bouquet of lime, meyer lemon, green apple, pear, and white peach. They exemplify the notions of ripeness, spice, and high acidity. Expect Alsatian Pinot Gris to be a little spendier than other varieties of this grape.\n\nBe sure to serve this wine ice cold. This wine pairs very well with light fishes such as perch, and soul. It also tastes amazingly well with chicken, turkey, duck or pork. Cruciferous vegetables are well complimented by the acid in the wine as are well spiced greens.","blurb":null,"interesting_facts":["Pinot Gris is a relative of Pinot Noir, and is the same grape as

The greyish-blue grape grows well in the cooler areas of California's Central Coast.\n\nMost Pinot Gris is dry with notes of stone fruit, and is more neutral than Moscato or Riesling. There are many different styles of Pinot Gris which vary based on the climate and terroir (the complete natural environment of the wine).\n\nPinot Gris and Pinot Grigio are the same grape. Pinot Grigio is the Italian clone of the Alsatian Pinot Gris. While they are the same grape they do infer different styles. Pinot Gris is full-bodied, a little more viscous and more conducive to aging. Pinot Grigio is light, crisp and ready to go straight out of the supermarket.\n\nAlong with Chardonnay and White Zinfandel, Pinot Gris often referred to as a “Mom Wine” given its popularity with the American middle-aged female population in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThink fish for your Pinot Gris. A little ceviche would be superb or perhaps some salmon or sashimi. American Pinot Gris tends to be a little more robust in the face of food and can withstand creamier dishes.","blurb":null,"interesting_facts":["The word pinot comes from the French word for pine

Noir has the well deserved reputation of being a finicky and difficult grape to cultivate. It thrives in cooler climates like Burgundy and the Willamette Valley in Oregon, but is also widely planted throughout sun-drenched California.\n\nPinot Noir reflects its terroir, or place of origin, more than just about any other variety. That's certainly part of its broad appeal, and right now, there is revolution happening in California.\n\nIn Pursuit of Balance or IPOB is a thriving group of producers founded on the notion that California Pinot Noir should be balanced, rather than decadent and lush—the prevailing style over the past few decades. Has the focus shifted? There are compelling arguments on both sides of the issue.\n\nIt pays to do a little research, then, to figure out which producers are making fully ripe, high octane Pinots and those that are making a style that accents subtlety and vibrant acidity. Not that both styles can't be great, they can be.\n\nRicher Pinot Noir, from warmer regions like the Russian River Valley tends to exhibit more dark fruit, in general, they are fuller wines with greater concentration and higher alcohol, up to 15% ABV.\n\nPinots from cooler regions like Sonoma Coast are lighter-bodied and display more red fruit, floral notes and have brighter acidity, often with a dash of minerality. Alcohol percentage and even the color of the wine can clue you in when shopping.","blurb":null,"interesting_facts":["“Sideways” catapulted California Pinot Noir to stardom, since the release of the

their viticultural horizons. A genetic cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault, this wine is deep and inky.\n\nTasting less like any of the two grapes that make it up, you will experience a wine that has more characteristics of a Shiraz with deep dark fruits and tobacco.\n\nPinotage started in the 1920s when a wine producer wanted to make a grape that grew as well as Cinsault, but had the characteristics of Pinot Noir. The result was something he did not expect.\n\nThe grape and wine that resulted was far darker than anticipated and little was known about how to best cultivate the crop.

This means that there is an introduction of some type of distilled spirit to the wine during production. These wines can achieve an ABV of 20% or more.\n\nYou will encounter one of two main types of port. The first, Ruby Port, is the most common. It has a deep ruby color, is sweet, and has relatively little exposure to oak. Tawny Port is brown in color, is aged longer, and draws its color and character from longer exposure to oak.\n\nThis wine is commonly used for desserts or a night-cap. Vintage ports, with an actual year of production i.e 1985, are far less common and usually quite spendy.

Classic Bordeaux varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec can be found, as well as Rhône varieties like Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre. There are also significant plantings of Italian varieties like Sangiovese, Nebbiolo and Barbera.\n\nWhat does that mean for wine buyers? Unlike California that is known for Napa Cabernet and Oregon that has championed Pinot Noir, Washington offers up a vast array of wines to choose from. Often wineries will specialize in a particular wine style—like the production of Rhône-style blends or Bordeaux-style wines.\n\nWashington produces world class wines. Overall, Washington reds can be characterized as being fruit-forward in expression, they are not as ripe nor as high in alcohol as many California wines, and they posses a degree of class and elegance that is reminiscent of Old World wines.

may be the most famous region in Spain, but Ribera del Duero is no slouch. These classic wines are made mostly from the grape Tempranillo.\n\nRibera del Duero wines are known for being strong, dark-colored wines filled with dark fruit, tobacco and vanilla flavors.\n\nThe sensual wines of Ribera del Duero are dark, brooding, and exciting. They are famous for taking the traditional Spanish grape Tempranillo and blending it with Bordeaux grapes Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.

This is due, in part to the dry, sunny climate and the soil types found in the region—a mix of granite, limestone, schist and sandstone are typical.\n\nThe true beauty of Alsatian Riesling, both the dry and off-dry version, is that they are extraordinarily food friendly.

Widely planted, though once derided, Riesling is the superstar of the white wine world at the moment.\n\nThere is a lot of scope for versatility with this sweet, viscous wine, though you can expect to get hints of tropical fruit, nectarine, melon and pineapple from a solid Riesling.\n\nThe grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills.\n\nThere are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.\n\nIt's a favorite in the food and beverage industry because of its willingness to play with a wide variety of foods, particular spicy dishes. The current Asian fusion boom is thought to have had a tremendous effect on Riesling's popularity.","blurb":null,"interesting_facts":["Riesling is grown all over the world and thrives in cool to warm

is arguably Spain's top wine region and is one of only two regions classified under the Denominación de Origen Calificada (DOCa) system. Its two most important red grapes are Tempranillo and Garnacha.\n\nAlthough red wines from Rioja are prized, Spanish wines generally offer great bang for the buck, allowing one to indulge in quality vino without breaking the bank!\n\nThere are four categories of red wine in Rioja. The youngest of these is “Joven”. “Crianza” wines are required to age for a minimum of 2 years, with 6 months spent in oak barrels. The next level is “Reserva” in which the wine ages for a minimum of 3 years, with at least 1 year in oak barrels. Finally, the most mature wines are labeled “Gran Reserva”. These wines mature for minimum 2 years in oak barrels, followed by at least 3 years in the bottle.\n\nTypically younger wines will be lighter in body style, exhibit more fresh fruit characteristics and are suitable to drink while young. Older wines have more developed flavor profiles, earthy characteristics, and are better suited to aging.\n\nThe medium body and high acidity in Spanish red wines from Rioja makes them excellent for pairing with a variety of foods. The approachable price points makes these wines of outstanding quality, readily available to enjoy sans guilt.","blurb":null,"interesting_facts":["Garnacha is known as “Grenache” in Spain and “Cannonau” in Sardinia.","85% of all wine grown in Rioja is red.","In Spain, wineries are most commonly known as “bodegas”.","Spain has some of the oldest wine vines in the world and was far less

Veneto region of Italy. The wine is produced by putting Valpolicella Classico under a second fermentation by adding the skins remaining from Amarone and Recioto production.\n\nThis winemaking process imparts additional complexity, tannin, body, and slightly higher alcohol to the wine. Both the body and price point of this wine are somewhere between a Valpolicella Classico and a true Amarone.\n\nRipasso wines are more approachable on both the palette and the wallet! They retail at far more accessible price points than true Amarone- generally in the $15-$25 price range.\n\nRipasso della Valpolicella is a wine based on the Corvina grape, with the addition of Rondinella and Molinara rounding out the blend.\n\nIn 2009, Ripasso della Valpolicella received its own DOC designation, along with its cousin, Amarone.

Blanc is the flagship varietal of New Zealand, and is typically a very crisp aromatic wine with notes of grapefruit, tropical fruit and cut grass.\n\nThe much-lauded white wines of New Zealand tend to be slightly sweeter than those from Bordeaux and the Loire Valley, and are hugely influenced by the growing conditions of the country.\n\nThe grape originates from Bordeaux, where it is also known as Pouilly-Fumé, Sancerre, and Graves, and is one of the world's most widely planted grapes.\n\nMarlborough is the most revered wine-producing region in the small country, accounting for 62% of all wine produced in New Zealand.\n\nThe New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc scene started popping in 1970s, with the high quality Sauvignon Blancs coming out of Marlborough illustrating the great potential for grape growing in New Zealand.\n\nSauvignon Blanc tends to be fermented in stainless steel vats, which results in a clean, crisp flavor, and will not show any of that butteriness that is often prevalent in well-oaked Chardonnay for instance.\n\nWhen it comes to pairing, think white meat, shellfish, and try to accentuate the herbaceous qualities of the wine with ingredients like parsley and cilantro.","blurb":null,"interesting_facts":["The name Sauvignon Blanc translates to “Wild White”.","Napa Valley legend Robert Mondavi pushed to rename Californian Sauvignon Blanc “Fume Blanc”.","New

South African Sauvignon Blanc offers you an excellent alternative to the considerably more expensive counterparts from New Zealand.\n\nSouth Africa was said to be producing some of the finest wines in the world in the 1700s, though some years later phylloxera wiped out most of the vines, and in the 20th century Apartheid significantly set back wine production.\n\nSouth Africa's stock in the world of wine is climbing rapidly. In the 80s and 90s they were well known for producing bottom shelf swill, but things have changed and the smart money is on the country becoming one of the next massive fine wine producing regions.\n\nWhen it comes to pairing, seafood always works fabulously with Sauvignon Blanc. You can also work some asparagus, cilantro or thyme into the mix as they will work wonderfully with the grassier elements of the wine.","blurb":null,"interesting_facts":["The Overberg region is

The hot climate is reflected in the wines and they are famous for their inexpensive, full bodied, warm, and fruit forward red wines based on Primitivo and Nero d’Avola. Less famous yet very interesting are the Sicilian wines from Mount Etna. The higher altitude yields wines that are lighter, fresh and complex. The indigenous grape Nerello Mascalese offers some fine examples.\n\nIn Campania and the northern part of Basilicata, winemakers have been finding success with the grape Aglianico (pronounced “ahl-YAH-nee-koe”). The slightly colder climate is ideal for this grape and produces wines that are garnet-colored with high tannins and acidity. Harsh when young, but after some aging they become elegant and complex, and reveal lovely plummy flavors with a hint of chocolate.\n\nIn Sardegna they lean more towards the grapes Carignano and Cannonau with French/Spanish origin.

With wonderful fizz, fantastic citrus, orchard and brioche notes, Californian sparkling wine provides a great alternative to overpriced Champagne.\n\nSparkling wine production in California started in 1892 with the Korbel Brothers in Sonoma County. They began producing what's regarded as the first quality sparkling wine in America using the méthode champenoise (the process of having secondary fermentation inside the bottle, thus creating the bubbles).\n\nMost Champagne and sparkling wine is made with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay grapes, two varietals that grow in abundance in California.\n\nSome of the finest sparkling wines in California come from Mendocino County, specifically in the Anderson Valley. Some of the big names are Scharffenberger, Roederer and Schramsberg.\n\nFor pairing with Californian sparkling wine you should look towards seafood.

While it originated in the Rhone Valley, many believe that it is being perfected in the Barossa region of Australia.\n\nEvery region along the beautiful Western Cape of South Africa produces Syrah, and warmer, drier areas further inland such as Swartland, have started to embrace the grape.\n\nSyrah loves dancing with bold foods that can stand up to their often-assertive personalities.

Australia's hot summers and cooler winters impart a complexity and structure that collects well and is a worldwide favorite.\n\nShiraz is described as robust and spicy with a slightly sweet finish. You will also enjoy a velvety and slightly syrupy mouthfeel when enjoying this varietal.\n\nGenetically identical to French Syrah, these grapes migrated to Australia in the 19th century and flourished taking on characteristics of indigenous flora. It is not uncommon to taste notes of Eucalyptus when enjoying this wine.\n\nGrowing to commercial prominence in the last decade of the 20th century, Shiraz is a fan favorite the world over and is a great wine for drinkers of different levels of experience.\n\nPeppery and deep, enjoy this wine with flavorful spicy foods from steak, to mediterranean and even latin cuisines. This wine can overpower more subtle dishes, so be cautions to avoid lighter proteins and unspiced seafood.","blurb":"Also known as Syrah","interesting_facts":["Syrah and Shiraz are genetically

The wine is often aged in American oak for varying lengths of time.\n\nConsidered the “Noble Grape of Spain,” Tempranillo has beautiful notes of plum, berries, cherries, and tomato on the nose and palate. One will also taste notes of tobacco, vanilla, herb, and leather resulting from oak aging.\n\nThis wine typically throws medium plus tannins, lower acid, with relatively medium alcohol.

They also tend to be somewhat more expensive compared to Sauvignon Blancs from other regions - but not necessarily without good reason.\n\nPouilly Fume to the east of the Loire river, and Sancerre to the west, each region's terroir imparts slightly different characteristics to their respective wines.

The classic pairing of Sancerre with grilled goat cheese is quite possibly the best thing to put in one's mouth.\n\nSomewhat collectable, a good vintage of Upper Noire white can shelve for up to ten years; although, that could be pushing it.

Full-bodied and aromatic, this wine is often compared to Sauvignon Blanc.\n\nOne of Spain's most popular cultivated white wines, Verdejo should hold a place in any wine enthusiast's collection. In order to qualify as Verdejo the grape in question must account for at least 50% of the juice in the bottle.\n\nThe grapes are harvested at night to control the temperature and then fermented in stainless steel. This interesting combination of winemaking techniques result in a well-rounded and complex juice that is loved the world over.\n\nExpect bright and fresh acidity with prevailing lemon, green apple, kiwi and pear.

The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.\n\nThe carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.\n\nBecause of the wine's bracing acidity and oceanic minerality it should be considered to be the ultimate partner to raw shellfish.","blurb":"White wine from Northern Portugal","interesting_facts":["Growers quite often plant their vines of telephone poles of large walls in order to grow fruit and vegetables beneath the vines.","Vinho Verde is a wine intended to be consumed young.","15% of Portugal's natural viticultural area is dedicated to the production of Vinho Verde."],"body":1,"body_description":"Very light-bodied","acidity":3,"acidity_description":"High","country":{"code":"pt","name":"Portugal","native_name":"Portugal","seo_name":"portugal","currency":{"code":"EUR","name":"Euros","prefix":"€","suffix":null},"regions_count":101,"users_count":609685,"wines_count":37637,"wineries_count":5190,"most_used_grapes":[{"id":67,"name":"Touriga Nacional","seo_name":"touriga-nacional","has_detailed_info":true,"wines_count":48721},{"id":68,"name":"Touriga Franca","seo_name":"touriga-franca","has_detailed_info":false,"wines_count":20059},{"id":69,"name":"Tinta Roriz","seo_name":"tinta-roriz","has_detailed_info":false,"wines_count":23104}]},"wine_type_id":2,"food":[{"id":13,"name":"Shellfish","background_image":{"location":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/ADrHxo56T5mjCwTmFktYbQ.jpg","variations":{"small":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/thumbs/ADrHxo56T5mjCwTmFktYbQ_932x810.jpg"}},"seo_name":"shellfish"},{"id":19,"name":"Vegetarian","background_image":{"location":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/WxPUf8WLTsWRR1yFXAKPzg.jpg","variations":{"small":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/thumbs/WxPUf8WLTsWRR1yFXAKPzg_932x810.jpg"}},"seo_name":"vegetarian"},{"id":27,"name":"Appetizers and snacks","background_image":{"location":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/OKUgIsF5Rrev1y_7ptvJFA.jpg","variations":{"small":"//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/thumbs/OKUgIsF5Rrev1y_7ptvJFA_932x810.jpg"}},"seo_name":null}],"grapes":[{"id":128,"name":"Arinto de Bucelas","seo_name":"arinto-de-bucelas","has_detailed_info":false,"wines_count":13208},{"id":149,"name":"Loureiro","seo_name":"loureiro","has_detailed_info":false,"wines_count":3523},{"id":546,"name":"Alvarinho","seo_name":"alvarinho","has_detailed_info":false,"wines_count":5375},{"id":548,"name":"Azal","seo_name":"azal","has_detailed_info":false,"wines_count":708},{"id":732,"name":"Avesso","seo_name":"avesso","has_detailed_info":false,"wines_count":453},{"id":752,"name":"Batoca","seo_name":"batoca","has_detailed_info":false,"wines_count":24}],"region":{"id":698,"name":"Vinho Verde","name_en":"","seo_name":"vinho-verde","country":{"code":"pt","name":"Portugal","native_name":"Portugal","seo_name":"portugal","currency":{"code":"EUR","name":"Euros","prefix":"€","suffix":null},"regions_count":101,"users_count":609685,"wines_count":37637,"wineries_count":5190,"most_used_grapes":[{"id":67,"name":"Touriga Nacional","seo_name":"touriga-nacional","has_detailed_info":true,"wines_count":48721},{"id":68,"name":"Touriga Franca","seo_name":"touriga-franca","has_detailed_info":false,"wines_count":20059},{"id":69,"name":"Tinta Roriz","seo_name":"tinta-roriz","has_detailed_info":false,"wines_count":23104}]},"background_image":{"location":"//images.vivino.com/regions/backgrounds/UpDWc8cKRJWxqq_fKZAuRg.jpg","variations":{"large":"//thumbs.vivino.com/region_backgrounds/UpDWc8cKRJWxqq_fKZAuRg_1280x760.jpg","medium":"//thumbs.vivino.com/region_backgrounds/UpDWc8cKRJWxqq_fKZAuRg_600x356.jpg"}},"class":{"typecast_map":{"background_image":{}}}}},{"id":239,"seo_name":"italian-vino-nobile-di-montepulciano","regional_name":"Italian","varietal_name":"Vino Nobile Di Montepulciano","name":"Italian Vino Nobile Di Montepulciano","image":null,"background_image":null,"description":"You may not be familiar with Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, but you should be.

California Zinfandel can be produced in various styles, ranging from light to full-bodied, they all exhibit a certain fruit forwardness that is frequently described as “jammy”. It is also known for licorice, spicy and peppery notes.\n\nZinfandel has gotten a bad rap from the abundant jugs of cheap, pink “white zin” lining the bottom shelves of many grocery store chains. However, this grape variety produces quality red wines that are food-friendly, versatile and delicious.\n\nZinfandel is outstanding when paired with barbecued red meats and bold cheeses, as its strong flavor profile can stand up to robust flavors. The fruit forwardness of this bold wine is balanced out by medium to high tannins, lending the wine firm structure.\n\nSome of the most prominent regions for producing quality California Zinfandel are Paso Robles, Napa Valley, Amador County, Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma and Lodi. Look for these regions when shopping for this all American wine to pair with your next barbecue.\n\nMost California Zinfandels have a relatively high alcohol content, ranging anywhere from 14-17% abv, so sip (and hydrate!) accordingly.","blurb":"Also known as Primitivo in Italy","interesting_facts":["The much maligned White Zinfandel was actually a mistake!
